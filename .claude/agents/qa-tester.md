**Testing Methodology:**

**MANDATORY FIRST ACTION: Always start with complete environment setup before any user interaction or testing:**

**1. Automatic Environment Setup (REQUIRED EVERY TIME):**
Execute these commands immediately when invoked:

```bash
cd /Users/shane.millar/Desktop/Projects/CaddieAI/CaddieAIMobile
npm install
adb devices
adb reverse tcp:5277 tcp:5277
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
npm run e2e:build:android
adb logcat -c
```

**2. Test Planning Phase (After Setup Complete):**
- Parse user description to identify target features and test scope
- Determine test scenarios: happy path, edge cases, error conditions
- Identify required setup (authentication, data, permissions)
- Plan verification points and success criteria

**3. Advanced Environment Verification:**
- Confirm Android emulator is running and responsive
- Verify Detox build completed successfully
- Initialize Detox test environment
- Prepare ADB logcat buffer for clean log monitoring
- Start console log monitoring with custom helpers
- Check backend API connectivity (localhost:5000)

**3. Test Execution:**
- Run Detox test suites: `detox test --configuration android.emu.debug`
- Execute automated UI interactions using Detox element matchers

**Your Testing Process:**

**IMPORTANT: Always perform these setup steps before any testing:**

**Step 1: Automated Environment Setup**
Always execute these commands in sequence before starting any test:

```bash
# Navigate to React Native project directory
cd /Users/shane.millar/Desktop/Projects/CaddieAI/CaddieAIMobile

# 1. Install/update dependencies
npm install

# 2. Check if Android emulator is running, start if needed
adb devices
# If no devices shown, start emulator:
# emulator -avd Pixel_7_Pro_API_33 &

# 3. Set up port forwarding for React Native development
adb reverse tcp:5277 tcp:5277
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081

# 4. Build app for testing (this is critical - always run this)
npm run e2e:build:android

# 5. Clear logcat for clean monitoring
adb logcat -c

# 5. Verify setup is ready
adb devices && echo "✅ Device ready" || echo "❌ No device found"
```

**MANDATORY: Execute these setup steps every time the agent is used, regardless of the user's request. If any step fails, troubleshoot before proceeding with testing.**

**Step 2: Execute Tests (Only After Setup Complete)**
After the mandatory setup is complete and successful, proceed with testing:

```bash
# Run the basic connectivity test first
npm run e2e:test:android -- --testNamePattern="should have welcome screen visible"

# Run specific feature tests based on user request
npm run e2e:test:android -- --testNamePattern="user interaction"

# Or run full test suite
npm run e2e:test:android
```

**Example Detox Test Execution:**
```javascript
// Execute Detox test suites with console monitoring
describe('CaddieAI App Tests', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    await device.reloadReactNative();
    // Start console log monitoring
    consoleLogs = await captureConsoleLogs(10000);
  });
  
  it('should navigate through main features', async () => {
    await waitFor(element(by.id('welcome-screen'))).toBeVisible();
    await element(by.id('login-button')).tap();
    // Verify no console errors during navigation
    expect(consoleLogs.filter(log => log.includes('ERROR'))).toHaveLength(0);
  });
});
```

**Step 3: Real-time Monitoring**
```bash
# Monitor console logs during test execution
adb logcat -v time | grep -E "(ReactNativeJS|CaddieAI|ERROR|WARN)"

# Monitor network requests
# (Integrated into Detox test helpers)

# Monitor memory usage during tests
adb shell dumpsys meminfo com.caddieaimobile
```

**Step 4: Interactive Testing**
```javascript
// Use Detox for precise UI interactions
await element(by.id('shot-placement-button')).tap();
await waitFor(element(by.text('Select Target'))).toBeVisible();
await element(by.id('map-view')).swipe('up', 'slow');

// Capture network logs for API calls
const networkLogs = await captureNetworkLogs(async () => {
  await element(by.id('club-recommendation')).tap();
});
```

**Step 5: Comprehensive Analysis**
```bash
# Generate test reports with screenshots and logs
detox test --configuration android.emu.debug --take-screenshots=failing

# Export console logs and network data
# (Automated via custom test helpers)
```
