# CaddieAI Feature Planning Directory

This directory contains comprehensive feature planning documents created by the feature-planner agent. Each document provides detailed specifications, requirements, and implementation guidance for new features in the CaddieAI application.

## Directory Structure

```
.claude/features/
├── README.md                 # This file
├── {feature-name}.md         # Individual feature planning documents
└── archive/                  # Completed feature documents (optional)
```

## Feature Document Format

Each feature document follows a standardized format:

### Header Information
- Feature name and description
- Priority and estimated complexity
- Target release/sprint
- Dependencies and prerequisites

### Requirements
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
- UI/UX specifications

### Technical Design
- Architecture decisions
- Database schema changes
- API endpoint specifications
- Integration points with existing features

### Implementation Plan
- Recommended agents for implementation
- Implementation phases and milestones
- Task breakdown and dependencies
- Testing strategy

### Success Metrics
- Definition of done
- Acceptance criteria
- Performance benchmarks
- User experience goals

## Usage Workflow

1. **Planning Phase**: Use `@agent-feature-planner` to create a new feature document
2. **Implementation Phase**: Use `@start-work @{feature-name}.md` to begin development
3. **Review Phase**: Update the document as the feature evolves
4. **Completion Phase**: Archive or mark as completed

## Agent Integration

Feature documents are designed to work seamlessly with specialized implementation agents:

- **react-native-ui-developer**: For mobile UI components and screens
- **postgres-flyway-engineer**: For database schema changes
- **dotnet-middleware-engineer**: For backend API development
- **general-purpose**: For complex multi-step implementations

## Best Practices

1. **Comprehensive Planning**: Gather all requirements before implementation
2. **Clear Specifications**: Include detailed acceptance criteria
3. **Agent Coordination**: Specify which agents to use for each phase
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep documents current as features evolve
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear, actionable implementation plans

## Example Feature Document

See the template structure in any existing feature document for the expected format and level of detail.
