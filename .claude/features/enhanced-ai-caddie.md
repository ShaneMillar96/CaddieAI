# Enhanced AI Caddie with Voice Intelligence

## Overview
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: 4 (1=Simple, 5=Complex)  
**Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Existing OpenAI Real-time API integration, Shot placement system, User skill level data

Transform the current AI Assistant tab into a comprehensive AI Caddie with voice-to-voice communication, shot type intelligence, and skill-based personalized responses. This feature replaces text-based chat with contextual, real-time voice interactions that adapt to user skill level and provide intelligent golf advice for any situation.

5. **Cost Controls**: Daily API usage monitoring with automatic limits
6. **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive testing across skill levels and golf scenarios

## Enhanced Features Detail

### Shot Type Intelligence
**Automatic Detection Based on:**
- Distance from pin (< 30 yards = chip, > 200 yards = drive)
- Current location context (tee box, fairway, rough, bunker, green)
- Shot placement history and patterns
- Course hole layout and hazards

**Contextual Responses:**
```typescript
// Example shot type logic
const detectShotType = (distanceToPin: number, currentLocation: string): ShotType => {
  if (currentLocation.includes('tee')) return 'tee-shot';
  if (currentLocation.includes('bunker')) return 'bunker-shot';
  if (distanceToPin < 30) return 'chip-shot';
  if (distanceToPin < 100) return 'approach-shot';
  if (distanceToPin > 200) return 'long-approach';
  return 'general-shot';
};
```

### Skill-Based Response Examples
**Beginner (Handicap 25+):**
- "For 150 yards, try a 7-iron and aim for the center of the green"
- "This distance might be challenging - consider laying up to 100 yards"

**Intermediate (Handicap 10-24):**
- "150 yards with slight headwind - use a 6-iron and aim just left of pin"
- "Green is elevated, club up one from your normal 150-yard club"

**Advanced (Handicap 0-9):**
- "150 yards, pin front left, 10mph headwind - 6-iron with controlled draw"
- "Sucker pin location - aim center-right, let it feed to the flag"

### Voice Interface Flow
```typescript
// Voice interaction state machine
enum VoiceState {
  IDLE = 'idle',
  LISTENING = 'listening', 
  PROCESSING = 'processing',
  SPEAKING = 'speaking',
  ERROR = 'error'
}

// Enhanced prompting for OpenAI
const buildAIPrompt = (shotType: ShotType, skillLevel: SkillLevel, context: GolfContext): string => {
  const skillInstructions = {
    [SkillLevel.Beginner]: "Use simple language, focus on basic fundamentals, suggest conservative targets",
    [SkillLevel.Intermediate]: "Provide club recommendations with basic course management",
    [SkillLevel.Advanced]: "Include technical details, wind/elevation adjustments, strategic options",
    [SkillLevel.Professional]: "Provide precise technical analysis with advanced course strategy"
  };
  
  return `Golf caddie advice for ${shotType}, skill level ${skillLevel}: ${skillInstructions[skillLevel]}. ${context.summary}`;
};
```
