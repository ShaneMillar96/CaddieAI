**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-16  
**Author**: Development Team  
**Reviewers**: Product Team, Technical Lead  
**Related ADRs**: None

## Context

### Problem Statement
CaddieAI requires golf course data to provide AI-powered recommendations and course-aware features. The application needs detailed course information including hole layouts, hazards, and geospatial data. We need to decide between using third-party APIs for course data or implementing a custom course data solution.

### Background
The application is in MVP development phase with limited budget for third-party API subscriptions. We need a solution that enables immediate development and testing while maintaining the flexibility to scale and integrate with commercial APIs in the future.

### Assumptions
- MVP development requires at least one complete course for testing
- Budget constraints prevent immediate third-party API subscriptions
- Future scaling will require comprehensive course data from commercial sources
- Database schema should support both custom and API-sourced data

## Decision

### Summary
We will implement a custom course data approach using Faughan Valley Golf Centre as our initial course, with database schema designed to support future API integration.

### Rationale
This approach provides immediate MVP functionality while maintaining cost-effectiveness and future scalability. The custom implementation allows us to validate core features without external dependencies or subscription costs.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: GolfAPI.io Integration
**Description**: Implement immediate integration with GolfAPI.io for comprehensive course data

**Pros**:
- Access to 42,000+ courses globally
- Complete course information and scorecards
- Professional data quality and accuracy
- Immediate global coverage
- Regular data updates

**Cons**:
- Subscription cost during development phase
- External dependency for core functionality
- Limited control over data structure
- API rate limits and potential downtime
- Requires budget approval for startup phase

**Implementation Effort**: Medium
**Risk Level**: Low

### Option 2: Custom Course Data (Selected)
**Description**: Implement custom course data using Faughan Valley Golf Centre with API-ready schema

**Pros**:
- Cost-effective for MVP development
- Complete control over data structure
- No external dependencies
- Immediate implementation possible
- Real Northern Ireland course for testing
- API-ready schema for future integration

**Cons**:
- Limited to single course initially
- Manual data entry required
- Estimated data rather than surveyed
- Requires future migration to API data
- Limited global coverage

**Implementation Effort**: Low
**Risk Level**: Low

### Option 3: Open Source Data
**Description**: Use OpenStreetMap and GitHub golf course data sources

**Pros**:
- Free and open source
- Some geospatial boundary data available
- Community-contributed data
- No subscription costs
- Good for basic course boundaries

**Cons**:
- Inconsistent data quality
- Limited hole-by-hole information
- Incomplete course coverage
- No standardized data structure
- Requires significant data processing

**Implementation Effort**: High
**Risk Level**: High

## Chosen Solution

### Selected Option
**Option 2**: Custom Course Data with Faughan Valley Golf Centre

### Justification
This option provides the optimal balance of cost-effectiveness, development speed, and future scalability. It enables immediate MVP development while maintaining the flexibility to integrate with commercial APIs when budget allows.

### Implementation Details
- **Database Schema**: Designed to accommodate both custom and API data
- **Course Selection**: Faughan Valley Golf Centre (Northern Ireland location)
- **Data Structure**: Complete course information with 18 holes
- **Geospatial Integration**: PostGIS for spatial operations
- **Future Migration**: API integration fields included

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Cost Savings**: No API subscription costs during MVP development
- **Development Speed**: Immediate implementation without external dependencies
- **Control**: Complete control over data structure and quality
- **Testing**: Real course data for comprehensive feature testing
- **Flexibility**: Schema ready for future API integration

### Negative Consequences
- **Limited Coverage**: Single course limits global applicability
- **Data Quality**: Estimated data rather than professionally surveyed
- **Maintenance**: Manual data updates required
- **Scalability**: Future migration required for global coverage
- **User Experience**: Limited course selection initially

### Trade-offs
- **Cost vs. Coverage**: Accepted limited coverage for cost savings
- **Speed vs. Quality**: Accepted estimated data for faster implementation
- **Control vs. Convenience**: Accepted manual maintenance for data control
- **MVP vs. Scale**: Optimized for MVP validation over global scale

## Implementation

### Action Items
- [x] Design database schema with API integration fields
- [x] Research Faughan Valley Golf Centre course information
- [x] Implement V1.4.0 migration with course data
- [x] Create course boundary and hazard mapping
- [x] Document data source and estimation approach
- [ ] Plan future API integration strategy

### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Custom implementation (Complete)
- **Phase 2**: MVP development and testing (In Progress)
- **Phase 3**: API integration planning (Future)
- **Phase 4**: Migration to commercial API (Future)

### Success Criteria
- [x] Complete course data for development and testing
- [x] Database schema supports future API integration
- [x] Zero third-party API costs during MVP phase
- [x] Geospatial features fully functional
- [x] AI features can provide course-aware recommendations

### Rollback Plan
- **Condition**: If custom data proves insufficient for MVP validation
- **Action**: Implement GolfAPI.io integration with budget approval
- **Effort**: Medium (schema already API-ready)
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for integration

## Monitoring & Validation

### Metrics to Monitor
- **Feature Usage**: How effectively AI features work with single course
- **User Feedback**: Quality of recommendations with custom data
- **Development Speed**: Impact on feature development velocity
- **Cost Savings**: Actual savings compared to API subscription

### Validation Approach
- **MVP Testing**: Comprehensive testing with Faughan Valley data
- **User Acceptance**: Validate features meet user needs
- **Performance**: Ensure geospatial operations perform well
- **Scalability**: Verify schema supports future API integration

### Review Schedule
- **Next Review**: After MVP completion
- **Review Frequency**: Quarterly or when scaling requirements change
- **Review Criteria**: User adoption, feature requirements, budget availability

## Risks & Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Risk**: Limited course coverage may restrict user adoption
   - **Likelihood**: Medium
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on Northern Ireland users initially, plan API integration for scaling

2. **Risk**: Estimated data may not be accurate enough for AI recommendations
   - **Likelihood**: Low
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Use reasonable estimates, collect user feedback for corrections

3. **Risk**: Manual data maintenance may become burdensome
   - **Likelihood**: Low
   - **Impact**: Low
   - **Mitigation**: Limit to single course, automate where possible

### Contingency Plans
- **Plan A**: If single course insufficient, implement GolfAPI.io integration
- **Plan B**: If data quality issues arise, source professional course data
- **Plan C**: If geospatial accuracy needed, use surveyed GPS coordinates

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **PostGIS**: Required for geospatial operations
- **Database Schema**: Must support both custom and API data
- **Migration System**: Flyway for schema management

### Team Dependencies
- **Development Team**: Implement custom data structure
- **Product Team**: Validate MVP requirements with single course
- **Future**: API integration team for scaling phase

### External Dependencies
- **Course Information**: Public information about Faughan Valley Golf Centre
