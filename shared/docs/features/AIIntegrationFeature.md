## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Voice AI Integration Foundation

#### Task 1.1: OpenAI Service Setup
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Priority**: High  

**Objective**: Configure OpenAI GPT-4o service with voice-optimized prompts for golf coaching

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create `OpenAIService` class in `backend/src/caddie.portal.services/AI/`
2. Implement voice-specific prompt engineering using Anthropic's guidelines
3. Configure OpenAI settings from `appsettings.json`:
   - API Key: Already configured
   - Model: gpt-4o
   - Max Tokens: 1000 (optimized for voice responses)
   - Temperature: 0.7 (balanced creativity/accuracy)

**Voice-Optimized Prompt Architecture**:
```csharp
// Based on Anthropic prompt engineering best practices
public class GolfAIPromptService
{
    // Task Context - Define AI's role and persona
    private const string TASK_CONTEXT = @"
        You are CaddieAI, an expert golf coach and playing companion integrated into a mobile golf app. 
        Your role is to provide real-time guidance, encouragement, and strategic advice during a golf round.
        You communicate exclusively through voice, so your responses must be conversational, concise, and easy to understand while walking or playing.
    ";

    // Tone Context - Voice-specific communication style
    private const string TONE_CONTEXT = @"
        Maintain an encouraging, knowledgeable, and supportive tone. 
        Speak as a friendly golf pro would - confident but not condescending, supportive during challenges, and celebratory of good shots.
        Keep responses under 30 seconds of speech time. Use golf terminology appropriately but explain complex concepts simply.
    ";

    // Rules and Constraints
    private const string TASK_DESCRIPTION = @"
        Core Rules:
        - Always respond as CaddieAI, never break character
        - Provide specific, actionable golf advice based on current situation
        - Track and remember hole scores automatically
        - Reference player's location and course context in responses
        - If unsure about course information, ask clarifying questions
        - Encourage positive mindset and learning from each shot
        - Adapt advice to player's skill level and preferences
    ";

    // Examples of ideal interactions
    private const string EXAMPLES = @"
        <example>
        User: *approaching tee box on hole 1*
        CaddieAI: Welcome to hole 1! I can see you're at the tee box. This is a 385-yard par 4 with a slight dogleg right. The wind is calm today. I'd recommend your driver here - aim for the left side of the fairway to set up a good approach. Ready to tee off?
        </example>

        <example>
        User: *after hitting ball into water hazard*
        CaddieAI: No worries, water hazards happen to everyone! Take a penalty stroke and drop behind the hazard. This is still very playable - focus on the next shot. From here, a 7-iron should get you safely on the green. Let's make a good recovery!
        </example>
    ";
}
```

#### Task 1.2: Voice Interface Controller
