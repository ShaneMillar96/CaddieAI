```

## Configuration

### Service Registration
```csharp
// Program.cs
builder.Services.AddScoped<IGolfStatisticsService, GolfStatisticsService>();
```

### AutoMapper Configuration
```csharp
// StatisticsMappingProfile.cs
CreateMap<PerformanceAnalysisModel, PerformanceAnalysisResponseDto>();
CreateMap<HandicapTrendModel, HandicapTrendResponseDto>();
// ... additional mappings for all statistical models
```

### Database Requirements
- Completed rounds (StatusId = 4) with comprehensive data
- Course information with par totals
- User handicap data
- Weather data (temperature and wind speed) for weather analysis

## Statistical Calculations

### Linear Regression Trend Analysis
```csharp
// Calculates improvement/decline trends
private double CalculateLinearTrend(IEnumerable<dynamic> dataPoints)
{
    // Uses least squares method for trend line slope calculation
    var slope = (n * sumXY - sumX * sumY) / (n * sumXX - sumX * sumX);
    return slope; // Negative = improving, Positive = declining
}
```

### Consistency Scoring
```csharp
// Converts variability to 0-100 consistency score
private double CalculateConsistencyScore(IEnumerable<double> values)
{
    var coefficientOfVariation = stdDev / average;
    return Math.Max(0, 100 - (coefficientOfVariation * 50));
}
```

### Performance Distribution
- **Under Par**: Rounds with negative score-to-par
- **At Par**: Rounds at even par (score-to-par = 0)
- **Over Par**: Rounds with positive score-to-par
- **Percentage Calculations**: Distribution percentages for performance categorization

## Performance

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for complex analytics (typically 200-500ms)
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient Entity Framework queries with selective loading
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing on Round date, user, course, and status fields

### Optimization Strategies
- **Query Optimization**: Uses Entity Framework Include() for relationship loading
- **Selective Data Loading**: Only loads completed rounds (StatusId = 4)
- **Statistical Efficiency**: In-memory calculations after data retrieval
- **Async Operations**: All database operations use async/await patterns

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- **JWT Required**: All endpoints require valid JWT token
- **User Isolation**: Statistics only show data for authenticated user
- **Authorization**: User ID extracted from JWT claims for data filtering

### Data Protection
- **No PII Exposure**: Statistics focus on performance metrics, not personal data
- **User Data Isolation**: Each user can only access their own statistics
- **Input Validation**: All request parameters validated before processing

## Usage Examples

### Service Layer Usage
```csharp
public class ExampleUsage
{
    private readonly IGolfStatisticsService _statisticsService;
    
    public async Task<PerformanceAnalysisModel?> GetUserPerformance(int userId)
    {
        var startDate = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now.AddMonths(-6));
        var endDate = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now);
        
        return await _statisticsService.GetPerformanceAnalysisAsync(
            userId, startDate, endDate);
    }
}
```

### API Client Usage
```javascript
// Frontend integration example
const getPerformanceAnalysis = async (startDate, endDate) => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/statistics/performance-analysis', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ startDate, endDate })
    });
    
    return await response.json();
};
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- **Strokes Gained Analysis**: PGA-style strokes gained calculations
- **Peer Comparison**: Anonymous comparison with similar handicap players
- **Predictive Analytics**: AI-powered performance predictions
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Chart data for trend visualization
- **Export Functionality**: PDF/Excel export of statistical reports

### Known Limitations
- **Weather Data**: Limited to temperature and wind speed (no precipitation)
- **Course Difficulty**: Basic difficulty rating based on user performance only
- **Historical Depth**: Statistics quality depends on round history completeness
- **Real-time Updates**: Statistics updated after round completion only

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Issue**: No statistics returned for user
   - **Cause**: User has no completed rounds (StatusId = 4)
   - **Solution**: Ensure user has completed at least one round

2. **Issue**: Inconsistent trend calculations
   - **Cause**: Insufficient data points for meaningful trends
   - **Solution**: Recommend minimum 5-10 rounds for reliable trends

3. **Issue**: Weather performance showing no data
   - **Cause**: Rounds missing temperature or wind speed data
   - **Solution**: Ensure weather data collection during rounds

### Debugging Tips
- Enable EF Core command logging to see SQL queries
- Check round StatusId = 4 for completed rounds
- Verify user JWT claims contain correct user ID
- Monitor database query performance with SQL profiling
